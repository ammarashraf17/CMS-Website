        My Education

      <div class="blog-post">
        <p>I have many fond memories when it came to intellectual achievement. Mostly, I can remember several intellectual achievement I get when learning. such as best student when I was in elementary school.</p>
        <p>In primary school, I also had an excellent performance in academic. I got 7A's in PT3 which is my family and I could be proud of. However, without the supportts of my parent, teachers and friends I could not achieve this achievement.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile in SPM, I got 6A's which helped me to enter the university at UiTM. At the university, I achieved a excellent CGPA for every semester. Currently, I got dean list for every semester(semester 1-semester 4).</p>
        <p>The accomplishment of activity most probably includes activities I do in competition physically or in a group.</p>
        <p>My first accomplishment is to compete in the district level in Silat competition. After months of training, I am forced to conduct a show battle between myself and my mate.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I was a mathematical and science club leader who participated in some of the school programmes. Moreover, I was also a captain of my school soccer team, whose duty I am very proud to have. My teammates supported me on the path so much.</p>
